Here is the list of the packages. Please click on the package to know more about it and how to use it. 

<a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_planning_toolbox/src">matlab_planning_toolbox</a> Matlab toolbox to explore and understand different motion planning algorithms. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kostas-alexis/matlab_safe_navigation">matlab_safe_navigation</a> Matlab toolbox to explore and understand exploration algorithms. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_environment_generation">matlab_environment_generation</a> This is a MATLAB package to define an environment as a grid map or a shape array. This package defines operations on the environment such as collision checking, distance calculation, visualization etc. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_cost_functions">matlab_cost_functions</a> This MATLAB package defines an interface for using a cost map. This is commonly used by trajectory optimization packages and planning packages in MATLAB. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_chomp">matlab_chomp</a> Matlab toolbox to explore chomp. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/representation_interface">representation_interface</a> This repository defines an interface for planning code to access perception data-structures <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/boustrophedon_decomposition">boustrophedon_decomposition</a> Boustrophedon_decompostion is cell decomposition of known map and create right to left and left to right path for each subcell and connect all the cells in shortest distance fashion.
