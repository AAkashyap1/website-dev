<!-- ## Introduction ##  -->
This novel dataset, **TrajAir**, provides recorded trajectories of multiple aircraft operating around a standard non-towered airport while also providing the weather conditions during these operations. TrajAir lends well for training, testing, and benchmarking algorithms related to trajectory prediction, including socially-aware models.

## Dataset ##
The dataset is collected at the Pittsburgh-Butler Regional Airport [ICAO:KBTP], a single runway GA airport, 10 miles North of the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Additional information about KBTP is available [online](http://www.airnav.com/airport/kbtp). The trajectory data is recorded using an on-site setup (see Fig. \ref{}). Data is provided starting on 18 Sept 2020 and going till 23 Apr 2021 and includes a total of 28 days of data discounting downtime, repairs and bad weather days with no traffic. Data is collected starting 01:00 AM local time to 11:00 PM local time.

More details. Total number of stuff.

### Collection Process
The dataset uses an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) receiver \cite{} placed within the airport premises to capture the trajectory data. The ADS-B In receiver receives data directly broadcasted by other aircraft with ADS-B Out. For aircraft that do not have a ADS-B Out, the Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) takes the position and altitude of aircraft using radar and converts that information into a format that’s compatible with ADS-B. It then broadcasts the information to our receiver \cite{}. The receiver uses both the 1090 MHz and 978 MHz frequencies to listen to these broadcasts. The ADS-B uses satellite navigation to produce accurate location and timestamp for the targets which is recorded on-site using our custom setup.

The weather data is obtained post-hoc using the METeorological Aerodrome Reports (METAR) strings generated by the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) system at KBTP. We use the Iowa State METAR repository \cite{} to gather all the weather data during the trajectory collection time-frame. The raw METAR string is then appended to the raw trajectory data by matching the closest UTC timestamps.




### Data Format
The data obtained from the ADS-B receiver and the METAR strings is processed to make it suitable for training networks. The following steps are performed:
* Removal of data points that have corrupt or no location fields.
* Removal of duplicate data points with same aircraft identifier and location fields.
* Removal of data points where the altitude is more than 6000 feet and distance is more than 5 kms from one end of the runway.
* Transforming the data to a local Cartesian coordinate frame in SI units. The origin is at the end of the runway with x-axis pointing along the runway.
* Processing raw METAR strings to get wind velocity and direction along and across the runway in the local Cartesian frame in SI units.
* Interpolating trajectory data every second for all agents using a cubic [verify] interpolation strategy.
* Segmenting the data into "scenes" with atleast one active aircraft in the airport vicinity. A scene starts when atleast one aircraft it active or enters the threshold and ends when all aircrafts have left the vicinity or are inactive (check max time).
