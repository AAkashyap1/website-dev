<p>The objective of this Department of Energy funded project is to use empirical testing, life cycle assessment, and systems analysis to research and demonstrate energy productivity of goods delivery improvement with drones, delivery robots and driverless cars compared to a baseline network. In addition, the research will develop proof-of-concept testing, model, and simulation for a smart curb space as an intelligently managed urban delivery zone for improved energy productivity and sustainability.</p>
