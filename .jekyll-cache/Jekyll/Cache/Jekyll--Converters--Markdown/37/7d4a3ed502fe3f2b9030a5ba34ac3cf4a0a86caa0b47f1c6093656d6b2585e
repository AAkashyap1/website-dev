I"<p>Azarakhsh is a 4th year Ph.D. student working on control for autonomous aerial robots. Currently, his focus is on developing methods for fully-actuated UAVs to have physical interaction with the world and to manipulate the environment. His past projects in the AirLab include autonomous UAV landing on moving platforms, trajectory planning in wind and autonomous real-time anomaly detection in fixed-wing robots.</p>
