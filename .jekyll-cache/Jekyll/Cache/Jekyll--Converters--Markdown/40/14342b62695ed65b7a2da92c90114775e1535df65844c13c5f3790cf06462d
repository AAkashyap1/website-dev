I"È<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Cherie! Iâ€™m a second-year PhD at the CMU Robotics Institute. I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 2017, where I worked with Prof. Chris Clark on shark-tracking underwater robots. I am supported by the Croucher Foundation.</p>

<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of field robotics, control theory and machine learning towards the goal of bringing robots into uncertain safety-critical applications. Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in developing robot learning and control algorithms that provide theoretical safety guarantees whilst deployed in the real world.</p>
