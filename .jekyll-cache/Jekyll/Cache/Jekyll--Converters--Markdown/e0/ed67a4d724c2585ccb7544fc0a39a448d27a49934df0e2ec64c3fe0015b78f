<p>The mobility of autonomous robots is still limited especially in real-world offroad terrain (as shown in the videos). We propose to enhance the autonomy of intelligent robots by actively learning the physical common sense and dynamic models of complex objects. This will enable these robots to automatically identify, understand and avoid difficult situations in adversarial environments, by learning physical models and robust skills in unstructured environments.</p>
