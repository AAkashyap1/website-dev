I"…<p>Hi, nice to meet you! Iâ€™m Andrew, a Masterâ€™s student at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s Robotics Institute. My research interests involve multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and planning for real world applications. Currently Iâ€™m working on autonomous drones for wildfire fighting and disaster relief. I previously graduated from San Jose State University with a B.S. in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.</p>

<p>On weekends, I enjoy basketball, badminton, and ping pong.</p>
