I"2<p>The autonomous landing of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on moving platforms has been an active area of research for several years. The applications include safer landing of aircraft on the ship, more efficient delivery networks and entertainment. Some of the key challenges of the problem include dealing with environmental conditions, such as changes in light and wind, and robust detection of the landing zone. The subsequent maneuver in trying to land also needs to take care of the potential ground effects at the proximity of the landing surface.</p>
