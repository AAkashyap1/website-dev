<p>The 2D to 3D registration problem is to match a query image with a 3D model to establish the geometric correspondences between the two modalities and estimate camera pose. Since camera and LiDAR are widely used instruments for scene interpretation and intelligent transportation, the 2D-3D registration is essential for many applications, e.g. point cloud colorization, camera to LiDAR calibration and camera localization. Low-cost LiDAR sensors usually capture geometric data without textured information. However, without textured information, it is difficult to recognize semantic information even for artificial visual interpretation. Based on the estimated transformation parameters, image textures can be used to colorize untextured point clouds, which is beneficial for further interpretation. With the developments of low-cost LiDAR sensors and the advancements in LiDAR-based {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)} algorithms, point cloud 3D models can be easily obtained. Thus 2D-3D registration can be used to localize a small lightweight camera inside pre-built 3D maps, which is attractive and complementary to existing visual SLAM technology.</p>
