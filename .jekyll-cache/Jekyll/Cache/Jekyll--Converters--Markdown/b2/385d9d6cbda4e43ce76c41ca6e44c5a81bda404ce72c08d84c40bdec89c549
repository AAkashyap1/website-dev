I"Í<p>Visual interesting scene prediction for mobile robots is one of the most fundamental research area in robotic. It is crucial for many robotic applications, such as robot exploration, decision making, and robot coorpertation, etc. Therefore, it is important to establish a sense of ‚Äúvisual interestingness‚Äù like humans for mobile robots. To promote the development visual interesting scene prediction for such purpose, we create this dataset for robots to better sense the world.</p>
