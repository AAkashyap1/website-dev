I am a post-doc in the Field Robotics Center of the Robotics Institute at CMU. I received my Ph.D. degree in nuclear engineering (yeah, that's true) from Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am always willing to experience, learn and implement the most awesome technology in the world. I am particularly interested in advancing artificial intelligence techniques and deploying and testing them in the real world. 

# Research interest #
- Binocular stereo reconstruction.
- Point cloud completion, scene completion.
