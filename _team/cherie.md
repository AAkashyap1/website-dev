Hi, I’m Cherie! I’m a second-year PhD Student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Sebastian Scherer. I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 2017, where I worked with Prof. Chris Clark on shark-tracking underwater robots. I am supported by the Croucher Foundation.

My research interest is in the intersection of field robotics, control theory and machine learning towards the goal of bringing robots to uncertain safety-critical environments. Specifically, I’m interested in developing robot learning and control algorithms that provide theoretical safety guarantees whilst deployed in the field.
