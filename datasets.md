## CMU Corridor Dataset

This is an image dataset (967 images) for corridor environments. All the images are annotated as ground or wall using polygons. It is a mixture of processed SUN RGBD (349, "corridor" category), SUN Database (327, "corridor" category), and self-collected images (291, in CMU).
