# General Information
The goal of this boot camp is to get each student started with the basics, broaden their horizon beyond their own research topic, understand the tradeoffs of different approaches in our context (real-time, flying robots, etc.) and make our students more “dangerous” with some code/tools that they can use to jump start their research.

There will be three sessions per day, covering the topics of <span style="color:blue">Perception</span>, <span style="color:#b50000">State Estimation</span>, <span style="color:green">Action</span>, and <span style="color:#e68200">Infrastructure</span>. Each session will consist of a 1 hour lecture followed by a 1.5 hour lab.
